SmallDraw in C#
===============

SmallDraw in C# is a port of a teaching application originally written in Java for the
[Design Patterns](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/softeng/subjects/DPA.html)
course of the
[Software Engineering Programme](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/softeng/)
at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/).

The original Java version was written by Eric Kerfoot and Jeremy Gibbons.
The C# version was commissioned for a special instance of the course in 2011.
A refined version has been rewritten in Java and is called SmallerDraw.

SmallDraw is based on [HotDraw](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HotDraw).
